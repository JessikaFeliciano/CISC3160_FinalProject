For CISC3160
The ToyLanguage project
I had several issues with classpaths and build paths and was running out of time to resolve
I also had trouble with github initially so this document serves as a test that my commits go through

The interpreter has a debug stack that i used while writing and can be displayed by using a second arguement inthe call

example:
java ToyLangInterpreter testInputs.txt 1

calling normally runs without the debug print
java ToyLangInterpreter testInputs.txt
