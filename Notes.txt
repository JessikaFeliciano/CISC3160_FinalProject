My name is Jessika Feliciano and this is my project for CISC3160
The ToyLanguage project
I had several issues with classpaths and build paths and was running out of time to resolve
I also had trouble with github initially so this document serves as a test that my commits go through

The interpreter has a debug stack that i used while writing and can be displayed by using a second arguement inthe call

example:
java ToyLangInterpreter testInputs.txt 1

calling normally runs without the debug print
java ToyLangInterpreter testInputs.txt

I tested on the inputs provided and the output was expected however my error messages and handling could have been better.
it works on the tested inputs but have not gone much further.
