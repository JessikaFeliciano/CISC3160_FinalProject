My name is Jessika Felciano
This is my Submission for CISC3160 Final project

There are still issues with readability and I have a bit of trouble getting the class pathing to work
all classes and methods have been moved to the interpeter to resolve this issue
ignore the tokenizer classfile as it does nothing!

when testing inputs please use each one one at a time since i hadnt figured out how to allow for reassignment of identifiers.
I had to rush through the documenting and commenting as i had a migraine starting so there are spelling mistakes and empty comments.

compile with:
javac ToyLangInterpreter.java

run with:
java ToyLangInterpreter testInputs.txt

The remains of my debugging can still be accessed
using the same method call with a second arguement will print Debug stack to the terinal
run(with printed debug):
java ToyLangInterpreter testInputs.txt 1


I will try to fix some errors that may be persistent such as the error handling and the issue of not cuasing leading zeroes error
